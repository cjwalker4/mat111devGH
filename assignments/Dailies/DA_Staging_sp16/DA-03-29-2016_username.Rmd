# Bats

A population of bats has wingspans that are normally distributed, with a mean Î¼ of 25 centimeters and a standard deviation of 5 centimeters.

Let X= the wingspan of a randomly-captured bat. Find each of the following probabilities, using `pnormGC()`.  Insert the code chunks!


## Part A:  P(X<27)



    
## Part B:  P(X>29)




## Part C:  P(20<X<30)



# Bat Percentiles

Back to the population of bats whose wingspans average 25 centimeters, with a standard deviation of 5 cm.  Use `qnorm()` to answer the following two questions.  Insert code chunks as needed.

## Part A

Harry the Bat has a wingspan that is right at the 35th percentile for all the bats. What is Harry's wingspan?




## Part B

Dolores the Bat has a wingspan that is longer than all but 25% of the bats. What is her wingspan?
