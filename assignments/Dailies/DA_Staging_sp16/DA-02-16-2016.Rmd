# Confounding Factors

We want to make a graph that helps us understand the relationship between **sat** and **ratio**, correcting for the confouding factor **frac**.

We would like to be able to trat **frac** as a factor variable, as well as a numerical variable.  Do we need to create a factor variable based on **frac**.  Make sure that you run this code:

```{r}
sat$fracGroup <- cut(sat$frac, 
                     breaks = 3, 
                     labels = c("low","middle","high"))
```

OK, now we can make our graph.  Notice that `sat` is in the code chunk below.  Highlight it, and then head to the Lattice Scatter Plot Addin, and make your graph.


```{r}
sat
```

After you correct for **frac** does it still seem that mean SAT scores in a state are unrelated to the student-teacher ratio in the state?
