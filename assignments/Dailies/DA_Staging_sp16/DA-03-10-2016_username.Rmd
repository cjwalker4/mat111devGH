## Attitudes:  Race and Sentence

We are interested in the following Research Question:

Who recommends higher sentences, on average:

* subjects given a form where the defendant's suggested race is Black?
* or subjects given a form where the defendant's suggested race is White?


## Part a

Is the data for our Research Question based on an experiment or on an observational study?



## Part b

We could have asked each subject the same question twice:

* once for Tyrone Marcus Watson
* once for William Shane Winchester

Then we would have had a repeated measures design.

Why did we not do this?
