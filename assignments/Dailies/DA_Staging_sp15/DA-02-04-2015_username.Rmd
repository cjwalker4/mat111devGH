# Sex and Seat:  Simulation

The code chunk below performs a chi-square test on the sex and seat question, using simulation.  A seed has been set, so the results will be the same whenver you run the code.  Run it now.


```{r}
set.seed(31415)
chisqtestGC(~sex+seat,data=m111survey,
            simulate.p.value="random",
            B=3000,graph=TRUE)
```

What's the P-value?

Here's the code we used earlier (no simulation).  Run it.

```{r}
chisqtestGC(~sex+seat,data=m111survey)
```


What's the P-value?


Is it about the same as the P-value you got using simulations?
