# A Confoudng Variable

Consider the following two variables, measured on adult males:

* **bifocals**:  whether or not you wear bifocals
* **prostate**:  whether or not you have prostate cancer

An observational study shows that **bifocals** and **prostate** are related:  the men in the study who reported wearing bifocals were about five times more likely to have prostate cancer than were the men who did not wear bifocals.

## Part a

What third variable might be a confounding variable in this study?


## Part b
