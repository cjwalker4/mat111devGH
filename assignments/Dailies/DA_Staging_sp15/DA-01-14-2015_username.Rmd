# Dolphin Communication:  Your Coin Flips


Imagine you are a dumb dolphin who can't communicate and guesses randomly.  Each guess is like a coin flip:

* Heads, you get a fish treat
* Tails you don't

Flip your coin 16 times. How many heads did you get?


## Dolphins Again:  Your App Simulations


How many times did you simulate?



What percentage of the time did you get 15 or more heads?



Suppose Buzz is just guessing: about what's the chance that he would get 15 or more correct?



Based on your results, do you think we have strong evidence that Buzz and Doris can communicate?
