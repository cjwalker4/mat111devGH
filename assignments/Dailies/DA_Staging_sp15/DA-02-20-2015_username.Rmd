# Is it Simple Random sampling?

You have a population of 1000 people, all lined up by order of their height.  You need a sample of size 10.

You pick a number at random from 1 to 100.  (Say you get 17.)

Then you pick people numbered:

17, 117, 217, 317, ..., 917

Is this procedure simple random sampling?  Why or why not?
