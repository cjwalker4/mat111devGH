# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
favstats(fastest~seat,data=m111survey)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
bwplot(fastest~seat,data=m111survey,
       xlab="Seating Preference",
       yalb="Fastest Speed Driven (mph)",
       main="Speed and Seating at GC")
```

# Practice

use R to add 2 and 2, by inserting the appropriate command inside the code chunk below.

```{r}

```
