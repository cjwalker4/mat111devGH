## The Gambler

<img src="dice_www_nj_com.jpg" style="width:250px;height:400px"/>

A Gambler comes to town.  He claims to play with fair dice, but the locals in the saloon are grumbling that he wins too often.  They think his dice are "weighted."

## Investigate!

* You impound one of the Gambler's dice.

* You are about to crack it open, to see if it's weighted.

* The Gambler says it's his "lucky" die, and begs you not to harm it.

* So you roll it sixty times instead.

##  Your Results

In 60 rolls, you get:

Spots|Observed Count
---|---
One|8
Two|18
Three|11
Four|7
Five|9
Six|7

## Discussion Time!

* If the die were fair, what would you expect to see (give or take some for chance variation in the rolling of the die, of course)?

* How does what you expect compare with what you observed?

* Any suggestions about how we might determine how much evidence these 60 rolls provide against the Gambler's claim that the die is fair?

## Implement

OK, try your method.  what do you think about the Gambler?  Should you let the locals ride him out of town on a rail?
